  You cut me down a tree</br>and brought it back to me<br/> And thats what made me see,</br>where I was going wrong.<br/>You put me on shelf</br>and kept me for yourself;</br>I can only blame myself,</br>you can only blame me.</br>And I could write a song, a hundred miles long</br>and thats where I belong</br>and you belong with me.
  </p>
  <p>
  And I could write it down</br>Or spread it all around</br>Get lost and then get found</br>Or swallowed in the sea
